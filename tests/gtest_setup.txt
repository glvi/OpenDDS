1. your OpenDDS git repo needs to have submodules enabled
the directory $DDS_ROOT/tests/googletest shouldn't be empty,
if it is, run "git submodule init" followed by "git submodule update"
see https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules

2. build the Gtest library
create the directory "build" in $DDS_ROOT/tests/googletest
run cmake with this new one as the build directory and
$DDS_ROOT/tests/googletest as the source directory
(if using Visual C++ and your OpenDDS build is not static,
enable gtest_force_shared_crt or BUILD_SHARED_LIBS) then
build with Gtest library with GNU Make or Visual Studio

3. configure and build OpenDDS as usual
any test executables that depend on Gtest can use the googletest.mpb
MPC base project (in $DDS_ROOT/MPC/config)
